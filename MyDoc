go: https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.15.darwin-amd64.pkg

Go to outer folder:
 make
to build the pkg

the output will be in bin folder: tidb-server

interesting atom based golang ide: https://atom.io/packages/ide-golang




=========================================================================
design info:

storage: mvcc as usual, version + key as primary key for kv store
 - kv stored ordered by key's binary order
 - RocksDB is used as local kv storage and interact with disk (same as other similiar spanner fans it seems)
 - kv store is done by sharding, the sharding is based on a range key instead of hashing data to nodes, Each segment is called a Region, Each Region can be described by [StartKey, EndKey)
 - PD is responsible for gathering data on which region maps to which node
 - by default all read/writes goes to raft leader!!!!???
 
 
 - replication:
   - raft is used for replication https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/tidb-storage
   - raft: https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf

trasntraction:
1. optimistic concurrent control: write to memory, commit by 2pc
 - if db and storage are both down, not sure what will happen
2. pemissitic concurrent control: row level locking, no gap lock, support read committed and repeatedable read
 - repeatable read: this is following the strategy of timestamp from PD.
 - as all trnastraction executions start with getting a timestamp from PD, they are ordered as well as all the records, it is not very hard to achieve what should be read
   and what shouldn't

PD: placement driver
 - this is critical as it is used to gather the timestamp. this must be availiable across all failures otherwise the system doesn't work at all.
